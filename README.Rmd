The goal of flexdashboard is to make it easy to create interactive dashboards for R, using R Markdown.

* Use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.

* Support for a wide variety of components including [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org); base, lattice, and grid graphics; tabular data; gauges and value boxes; and text annotations.

* Flexible and easy to specify row and column-based [layouts](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/reference/articles/articles/layouts.html). Components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices.

* [Storyboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/reference/articles/articles/using.html#storyboards-1) layouts for presenting sequences of visualizations and related commentary.

* Optionally use [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to drive visualizations dynamically.

## Installation

Install the **flexdashboard** package from CRAN as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flexdashboard")
```

To author a flexdashboard you create an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document with the `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` output format. You can do this from within RStudio using the **New R Markdown** dialog:

If you are not using RStudio, you can create a new `flexdashboard` R Markdown file from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("dashboard.Rmd", 
                 template = "flex_dashboard", 
                 package = "flexdashboard")
```
